quantum synchronization with dephasing/coupling

number, coherent, thermal state time required to reach steady state, outside and inside limit cycle.

What affects the speed at which a state becomes classical (steady-state)

>find quantum speed limit.

>check acf for synchronized vs not.

>test speed to reach synchronization depending on initial condition.
